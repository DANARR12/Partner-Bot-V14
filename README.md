## Logging

- Logs are written to both console and `bot.log` file
- Different log levels for debugging and monitoring
- Error tracking for troubleshooting

## Security Features

- Rate limiting to prevent XP farming
- Input validation and error handling
- Atomic file operations to prevent data corruption

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start
- Check that your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correctly set in `.env`
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server

### XP not being awarded

- Verify the user isn't muted/deafened (for voice XP)
- Check the console/log file for error messages

### Data corruption
- The bot automatically creates backups of corrupted files
- Look for `.backup` files in your directory
