# üîí Discord Bot Security Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Your Token Was Exposed!

The Discord bot token you shared publicly has been compromised. **You must take immediate action:**

### 1. Regenerate Your Bot Token (URGENT!)

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your bot application
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Click "Regenerate Token"
5. Copy the new token (you'll only see it once!)

### 2. Secure Token Storage

**‚úÖ CORRECT WAY:**
```bash
# In your .env file (already created for you)
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_new_regenerated_token_here
```

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:**
- Don't put tokens directly in code files
- Don't commit tokens to GitHub/Git
- Don't share tokens in chat/Discord
- Don't store tokens in plain text files

### 3. Environment Setup

1. **Edit the .env file:**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Replace the placeholder with your new token:**
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_new_token_here
   ```

3. **Start your bot:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4. What's Already Protected

‚úÖ `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed to Git)
‚úÖ Bot code uses `process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN`
‚úÖ `dotenv` package installed and configured

### 5. Additional Security Tips

- **Never share your token** with anyone
- **Use different tokens** for development and production
- **Monitor your bot's activity** regularly
- **Keep your dependencies updated**
- **Use bot permissions carefully** (principle of least privilege)

### 6. If Your Bot Gets Compromised

1. Regenerate the token immediately
2. Check your server logs for suspicious activity
3. Review bot permissions and remove unnecessary ones
4. Consider changing your Discord account password
5. Enable 2FA on your Discord account

## üö® Remember: Treat bot tokens like passwords - keep them secret!
